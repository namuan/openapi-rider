## Task 1:

#### Create new project and enter Info details:

The first page is simple as it'll ask the user to either create a new project or upload an existing spec.

Initially, we will only start with creating a new project.

![Welcome Page](../images/welcome_page.png)

When `Create New Project` button is clicked, the user will move to the second page which looks like this

![Info Editor](../images/OpenAPI_Editor__Info.png)

The tabbed interface on the top will have multiple tabs. We'll only work with `Info` tab for this task.
